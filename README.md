## Introduction

A machine learning-based diagnostic model for early detection and accurate classification of heart disease in patients.

## Problem Definition

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs. We are using a dataset that contains 11 features to train and test our machine learning model.

## Features

- **Age**: The age of the patient
- **Sex**: The gender of the patient
- **Chest Pain Type**: Type of chest pain experienced
- **Resting Blood Pressure**: Resting blood pressure in mm Hg
- **Serum Cholesterol**: Serum cholesterol in mg/dl
- **Fasting Blood Sugar**: Fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
- **Resting ECG**: Resting electrocardiographic results
- **Max Heart Rate**: Maximum heart rate achieved
- **Exercise Induced Angina**: Exercise induced angina
- **ST Depression**: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
- **Slope**: The slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- **Number of Major Vessels**: Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- **Thalassemia**: Thalassemia status

## Getting Started
