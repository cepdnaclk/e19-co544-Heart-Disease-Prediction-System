## Introduction

A machine learning-based diagnostic model for early detection and accurate classification of heart disease in patients.

## Problem Definition

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death globally, taking an estimated 17.9 million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5 CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and we are using a dataset that contains 11 features to train and test our machine learning model.
